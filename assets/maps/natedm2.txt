* LEVEL DESCRIPTION *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
my second Quake3 level.. this includes custom mapobjects which really gives it a
unique look.  I'm hoping to start a trend here with  the mapobject thing,
hopefully other mappers will gain an interest in creating map objects and make
some really nice levels.  The possibilities are endless with mapobjects!

Feel free to use my models for your custom levels just give me some credit 
(please). if you'd like to get a hold of the source files (3dstudios stuff) send 
an email.
