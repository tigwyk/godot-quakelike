Map description         : My first experiment with Quake3 map building...
                          Actually a semi-conversion of my latest Q2/Q1
                          map "Farewell to Fudge Brownies", but in a 
                          completely different theme.

                          I ran into trouble with all the curves... Seems
                          like Q3 doesn't really like as curvy architecture
                          as we're used to with Quake and Quake2 levels;
                          the texture alignment was damn near impossible,
                          and even when it looks perfect in the editor,
                          the curves don't perfectly blend into the 
                          environment in game, resulting in visible seams :-(

                          Anyway, I kind of like this little map... Very
                          non-Quake3-ish theme with smooth and clean gameplay.
                          Supports bots and stuff.
