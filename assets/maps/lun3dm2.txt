        Known Issues : The Quake3 bots are UNBELIEVABLY STUPID.  ... so that isn't really an 
                       issue with the map as such, but it certainly affects solo play.  
                       Several items, including the RL, require a simple jump to reach.  The 
                       Q3 bots are completely incapable of jumping to anything without the 
                       assistance of a jumppad, and henceforth none of them can get the RA 
                       without dropping onto it from above, none use the RL, and none go for 
                       the Regen or Megahealth.
                     : I have tried several user add-on bots, and the only one that adds 
                       capability of jumping to an item is the RWG_BotAI tweak, 
                       (http://www.quotientsystems.com/q3), and even then performance is damn 
                       sorry.  They do actually grab the RL and MH, but only once in a blue 
                       moon.
                     : Henceforth, I strongly reccomend you play this map with living beings 
                       until some better bots come out (or you die, whichever comes first).  
                       If you are a diehard solo person like I am, use the RWG bot or, likely 
                       more enjoyably, play a different map altogether.
                     : In an ideal world, the pulse of the lights would sync with the pulse of
                       the sound, but Q3 apparently does not aggressively track what times 
                       things happen, and so the two can sometimes come out of sync after a
                       teleportation or a visit to the MH.
                     : The engine likes to apply a very light blue haze of fog to the cieling
                       of the dome room.  It's invisible if you aren't looking for it and 
                       doesn't affect gameplay.
