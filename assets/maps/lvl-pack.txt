 i,    what to do
 ii,   single play support
 iii,  authors and maps
 iv,   running a server
 v,    who did this?
 vi,   some info
 vii,  thanx, credits 
 viii, copyright info



----what to do-------------------------------------------------

Extract the contents of lvl-pack.zip to your baseq3 folder. 
Start a game as per normal. Some levels will only appear in the 
Tourney menu, others only in the Free For All.

If you wish to play the maps as a 4 Teir single player mission 
see below for more info.


----single play support----------------------------------------

Included with this pack is a file called lvl-pack-sp.zip. This 
file contains "lvl-creamontop.pk3" which will create a 4 Tier 
single player game of all of the maps.

Extract (with directory structure) to your main Quake III Arena 
folder. Once this is done there will be a "lvl-pack-sp" folder 
under your main Q3A folder.

In the "lvl-pack-sp" folder you should find the following files:
 - lvl-creamontop.pk3
 - lvl-pack.txt (a copy of this file)
 - lvl-pack.bat
 - lvl-pack-ioquake3.x86.bat

If you want to "record" your stats and progress through the 4 
tiers, you need to start the game with "+set fs_game lvl-pack-sp". 

For Windows users, you can use the included "lvl-pack.bat" (for 
standard Quake3) or "lvl-pack-ioquake3.x86.bat" for IOQuake3 
users.

Mac and Linux users will need work out how to do this.

While you can use the Quake 3 menu system to select the 
"lvl-pack-sp" mod and start the single player mission, your 
"stats" and tier progress is NOT recorded this way.

Bot play is not great on all the maps, but its better than 
nothing :]

----running a server-------------------------------------------

Also included are three map cycle files for server admins;

* lvl-pack.cfg - contains all the maps, suits 2 to 6 players
* lvl-pack-sm.cfg - targeted at 2 to 4 players games
* lvl-pack-big.cfg - optimal for 4 to 6 player games

If you currently run a server you will know what to do with 
these. If your new to it all, start your server and type the 
following at the console;

\exec lvl-pack.cfg 
(or lvl-pack-sm.cfg or lvl-pack-big.cfg)

This will start the map cycle and set the timelimit at 15 
minutes with a fraglimit of 50. After a lot of play testing 
I've found this to be a very comfortable set-up for a LAN or 
online server.


----who did this?----------------------------------------------

The ..::LvL pack was put together by Tigger-oN with full 
permission given by the level authors. For more info check 
out - http://lvlworld.com/


----some info--------------------------------------------------

After 11 months of map reviews at ..::LvL I've decided to put 
together some of the best maps in one big fat download. The 
maps included are some of my favourites. I've included levels 
that I feel are great for playing humans on a small LAN or 
online server. Bots files are included however the maps are 
best against humans. For practical reasons there are only 16 
maps included.

Challenge Pro Mode comes highly recommended with this pack. 
You can grab the latest build from http://www.promode.org/

lvl-pack-textures.pk3 contains a few missing textures and 
scripts from the maps included in the pack.


----thanx, credits---------------------------------------------

Big fat thanx with a huge cherry on top goes out to all the 
mappers who have work in this pack.

Another big fat thanx goes out to all the mappers that have 
submitted work to ..::LvL over the last 11 months, its you lot 
that has kept ..::LvL going strong.

And one more big fat thanx goes out to all the people that drop 
by ..::LvL and leave a comment about the maps (or just drop to 
check out what's new)
